# Weibull-and-Life-Cycle-Analysis
📌 Project Summary: Weibull Reliability Analysis ✅ Objective: This project aimed to analyze the reliability and failure characteristics of a system/component using the Weibull Distribution. The goal was to predict failures, estimate lifespan, and guide maintenance decisions based on statistical modeling.
📊 Steps & Key Findings:
1.) Parameter Estimation
 Weibull Shape Parameter (β): 1.7977
 Weibull Scale Parameter (η): 3654.93 hours
 MTTF (Mean Time to Failure): 3250.48 hours → The expected average time before failure.

2.) Reliability & Failure Probability Analysis
 Reliability Curve: Probability that the system survives over time.
 Failure Probability Curve: Increases over time, indicating rising failure risks.
 Used to estimate system durability and plan preventive maintenance.

3.) Weibull Probability Plot
 Assessed the goodness-of-fit for Weibull distribution.
 Data points closely followed the theoretical line, confirming Weibull suitability.

4.) Hazard Rate Function
 Shows an increasing failure rate over time → Wear-out failures dominate.
 Suggests that components should be replaced before reaching a critical failure threshold.

5.) Mean Residual Life (MRL) Function
 Initially increases, indicating a stable phase.
 Peaks (~1000 hours), suggesting an optimal maintenance window.
 Declines sharply, meaning aged components are prone to failure.
 Helps determine the best time for preventive maintenance or replacement to avoid unexpected breakdowns.


🔎 Significance & Real-World Applications:
📅 Maintenance Planning: Predict optimal maintenance/replacement schedules.
🔬 Reliability Engineering: Assess product/component lifespan and failure patterns.
🏭 Industrial Use: Prevent downtime in manufacturing, aviation, or electronics.
📉 Risk Assessment: Reduce failure risks and improve system durability.
